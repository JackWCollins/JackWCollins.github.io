• Conceptualized, designed, and developed large-scale features for our web and mobile applications such as appointment scheduling systems, membership and "class pack" functionality, and seamless payment processing that our B2B clients used to charge their end users (hence the B2B2C designation).
• Organized and ran check-ins with our largest customers to fully understand their needs and ensure that our product was solving their problems effectively.
• Grew the product and infrastructure from processing $100 per day when I joined to over $100,000 per day by the time of our acquisition.
